# Corona Joust 
ArcadeGameFinalProject
This is our final project for CSSE 220!!

It is a game made completely in Java based off of the game Joust.
The game follows the protagonist Chad whose goal is to kill off covid-19 with his disinfecting spear and the virus will drop Corona Bottles to drink which is his score. But you have to hurry or they will get infected again and come back to life!
